  The first step to spellcasting is getting a wand. The Apprentice Wand can be made of simple mundane ingredients fashioned as specified in the recipe shown here.
<~><~>   With your wand, you can now select spells from a spellbook. To do this place a spellbook onto a podium, turn to the page of the spell you want to use, open your Spell Slot gui using the Spell Button (R key by default), select the spell slot you want to store the spell in using the scroll wheel on your mouse, and right click the podium. A podium can be made of most types of wood with this recipe.
<~><~>   While using an Apprentice Wand a Magician can only access one Spell Slot to store spells from their Spellbooks, whereas more advanced wands have access to a number of Spell Slots dependent on their magician level.
