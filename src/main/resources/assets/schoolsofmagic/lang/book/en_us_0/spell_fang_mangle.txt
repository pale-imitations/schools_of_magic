  This spell conjures gnashing fangs forth from the void to the caster's aid in battle.
<~><~>  The fangs will burst forth in a line in the direction the spell is cast in. However if the caster is crouching the fangs will instead form two rings around the caster.
<~><~>  By default the spell can be cast four times per third level spell charge, however the use of higher level spell charges will grant an extra two uses per charge above third.
