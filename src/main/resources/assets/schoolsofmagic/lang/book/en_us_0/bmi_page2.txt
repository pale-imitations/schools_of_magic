  The Dryad is a nature spirit whose life force is connected to a tree. These trees are valuable for their unique wood, which can be fashioned into extraordinary wands.
<~><~>  The Dryad will grant you one of these wand cores if you prove yourself worthy by completing her quest.
<~><~>  A less scrupulous magician may attempt to kill the dryad for a wand core, however the Dryad is not so easily killed.
<~><~>  These nature spirits have an innate spellcasting ability that they will use to defend themselves and their forests, to carry an axe in her presence is to tempt her wrath.
