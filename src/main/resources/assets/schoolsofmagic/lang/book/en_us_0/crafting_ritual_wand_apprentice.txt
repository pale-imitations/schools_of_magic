  The Apprentice Wand can be upgraded three times using a Crafting Ritual shown here.<~><~>  Each upgrade requires a diamond and a little more mana.<~><~>  TIP: Throw the wand into the Brazier instead of right clicking, right clicking with a wand will attempt to start the ritual. Also you can start a ritual with a Stick, but you'll still need mana.
